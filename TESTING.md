# Testing the XO-OS Bootloader

## What Changed

The bootloader now **actually loads and executes the kernel** instead of just printing a placeholder message. Here's what it does:

1. **Loads kernel.elf** from the same device/partition as the bootloader
2. **Parses the ELF file** and validates it (64-bit x86_64 executable)
3. **Allocates memory** for each LOAD segment at the required addresses
4. **Copies program data** from the ELF file to the allocated memory
5. **Exits UEFI boot services** (transitions from firmware to OS)
6. **Jumps to the kernel entry point** at 0x100000

## Kernel Behavior

The simple test kernel:
- Receives boot information from the bootloader
- Validates the boot info magic number
- If graphics are available, draws a test pattern (red, green, blue rectangles)
- Enters an infinite loop with HLT instructions

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build everything
make clean && make all

# Show file information
make info

# Test with QEMU (requires OVMF UEFI firmware)
make test-quick
```

## Testing Manually

You can also copy the files from `build/esp/` to a FAT32 formatted USB drive with UEFI:

```
USB_DRIVE/
├── EFI/
│   └── BOOT/
│       └── BOOTX64.EFI
└── kernel.elf
```

## Expected Output

The bootloader should display:
1. "XO-OS UEFI Bootloader v1.0"
2. "Getting memory map..."
3. "Initializing graphics..."
4. Boot information summary
5. "Loading kernel..." 
6. "Kernel loaded successfully (XXXX bytes)"
7. "Parsing ELF and loading segments..."
8. "ELF segments loaded successfully"
9. "Kernel entry point: 0x100000"
10. "Getting final memory map..."
11. "Exiting UEFI boot services..."

Then the kernel takes over:
- If graphics are available, you'll see colored rectangles on screen
- System will appear to hang (this is normal - kernel is running in infinite loop)

## Troubleshooting

If kernel loading fails:
- Check that kernel.elf is present in the same directory as BOOTX64.EFI
- Ensure the ELF file is a valid 64-bit x86_64 executable
- Verify memory allocation isn't failing (insufficient RAM)

## Architecture

This implementation demonstrates a minimal but complete UEFI bootloader that:
- Uses EFI Simple File System Protocol to read files
- Implements a basic ELF64 loader
- Properly transitions from UEFI to kernel execution
- Passes structured boot information to the kernel

The kernel receives comprehensive boot info including memory map, graphics framebuffer, UEFI details, and hardware information.
